VERDICT Cyber Resiliency Verifier (CRV) back-end tool performs a formal analysis of the updated model with respect to formal cyber properties to identify vulnerabilities to cyber threat effects. This valuable capability provides an additional depth of analysis of a model that includes behavioral details of the architectural component models which will help to catch design mistakes earlier in the development process. Once the CRV analysis is complete, the developer will go off and create a detailed implementation.
